# ArtHeist

A 2D platformer game developed for the 2020 DemonHacks Hackathon. Players navigate through levels, interact with game elements, and face enemies in pursuit of a museum heist theme.

## Tech Stack & Technologies

- **Language:** Python
- **Game Modules:** Custom modules such as `player.py`, `level.py`, `enemy.py`, `painting.py`, `score.py`, etc.
- **GUI / Game Engine:** Built using the Pygame library
- **Testing / Utilities:** Contains `test.py` for verifying game logic components
- **Assets:** Custom made UI components (sprites, images, and level artwork)

## Key Features

- Multi-level platformer gameplay with obstacles, enemies, collectible items, and scoring  
- Player movement and collision logic via `player.py`, physics in `level.py`  
- Enemy behavior and interaction logic (`enemy.py`)  
- Persistent scoring and level progression logic (`score.py`)  
- Test harness for validating core functionality (collision, game state, etc.)

## Highlights

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in **game development using Python**, modular architecture of game systems (player, enemies, levels), and custom logic for collision, scoring, and asset management. It highlights the ability to rapidly prototype engaging gameplay mechanics under hackathon constraints.
